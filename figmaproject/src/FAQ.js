          <p>
            My design process typically involves four key phases: research, design, prototype, and test. 
            In the research phase, I gather insights about the user and their needs. In the design phase, 
            I create wireframes and visual designs that meet those needs. In the prototype phase, I create 
            interactive models of the design for testing. In the test phase, I collect feedback from users 
            to refine the design.
